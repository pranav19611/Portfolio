                        Hello there! My name is Pranav Khatavkar, and I'm a
                        Mechanical Engineering major at MIT Academy of Engineering. Welcome to my digital portfolio!
                        <br>
                        As a college student, I'm passionate about Airplanes, Coding, Athletics, and I've had the opportunity to explore
                        these interests through my coursework and extracurricular activities. My time at MIT AOE has helped me to
                        develop skills in Core Mechanics, Web Desiging, Aeroplane Designing, Programming, and I'm excited to showcase
                        some of my best work in this digital portfolio.
                        <br>
                        Throughout my college career, I've been involved in a number of extracurricular activities, which have allowed
                        me to gain hands-on experience in Management, [others], . [Internships].
                        <br>
                        In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I enjoy Sports, History, Stock Market, Music and
                        Spiritualism which helps me to stay balanced and inspired. I'm always looking for new challenges and
                        opportunities to learn, and I'm excited about the possibilities that the future holds.
                        <br>
